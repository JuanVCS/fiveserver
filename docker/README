Fiveserver in Docker
====================


Build
~~~~~

To build the docker image, run:

make


Prep
~~~~

Fiveserver and Sixserver run in containers under non-privileged user,
called "five", with pre-defined uid=3066 and gid=3066. Although it is
not strictly necessary, to make things sane, you should create a group
and a user with such ids:

groupadd -g 3066 five && useradd -u 3066 -g five five 

In most cases you would want to have your configuration
and the logs outside of the docker containers. This makes
it possible to modify config, rotate the logs, etc.
To prepare the configuration and log directory, run:

mkdir /opt/five
docker run --rm -v /opt/five:/tmp fiveserver /opt/fiveserver/docker-prep.sh

Now you should see default configuration files in /opt/five/etc/conf
The log dir (with correct user permissions) is /opt/five/log


Run
~~~

To create and start new containers:

Fiveserver:
docker run -d --net=host --name=fiveserver --restart=always -v /opt/five/etc:/opt/fiveserver/etc -v /opt/five/log:/opt/fiveserver/log -e SVC=fiveserver fiveserver

Sixserver:
docker run -d --net=host --name=sixserver --restart=always -v /opt/five/etc:/opt/fiveserver/etc -v /opt/five/log:/opt/fiveserver/log -e SVC=sixserver fiveserver
